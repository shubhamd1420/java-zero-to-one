Here, I want to go over the basics of Java again from start.
Motivation: During today's interview, I had some difficulty writing Deadlock code and made a mistake in the syntax of Comparator.

I believe the reason this occurred is that we frequently search for syntax online, copy it, and utilize it in our work. 
However, interviews vary in that they expect you to retain the syntax; Google is not allowed to aid you with this.
So that I don't miss anything crucial, I'll be following https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm step-by-step.
Although it will take time, it appears to be worth the investment!

I'm hoping to finish this series quickly and gain a lot of knowledge.
